Although Adenocor  is not effective in converting atrial flutter, atrial fibrillation or ventricular tachycardia \n","to sinus rhythm, the slowing of AV conduction helps diagnosis of atrial activity. \n","In this respect adenosine should be used as an adjunct to, but not a replacement for, clinical \n","and ECG observations.  It should be used only when, despite all diagnostic attempts, doubt still persists.  \n","Improved diagnostic sensitivity of intracavity electrophysiological investigations.\n"," \n","4.2 DOSE AND METHOD ADMINISTRATION  \n","Adenocor should be  used only in hospitals, with monitoring and cardiorespiratory resuscitation \n","equipment available for immediate use if necessary.  It should be administered by rapid IV bolus injection according to the ascending dosage schedule below.  To be certain the sol ution \n","reaches the systemic circulation, it should be administered either directly into a vein or into an adenocor -ccdsv9 -piv6 -23aug22 Page 2 of 12 IV line.  If administered via an IV line it should be injected as proximally as possible, and \n","followed by a rapid saline flush.  \n","Adenocor should only be  used when facilities exist for cardiac monitoring.  Patients who \n","develop high- level AV block at a particular dose should not be given further dosage increments. \n","Therapeutic Dose  \n","Adults  \n","Initial dose:  3 mg given as a rapid intravenous bolus (over 2 seconds). \n","Second dose:  If the first dose does not result in the elimination of supraventricular tachycardia \n","within 1 or 2 minutes, 6 mg should be given also as a rapid intravenous bolus. \n","Third dose:  If the second dose does not result in the elimination of supraventricular tachycardia \n","within 1 or 2 minutes, 12 mg should be given also as a rapid intravenous bolus. \n","Children \n","No controlled paediatric studies have been undertaken, therefore the level of evidence does not \n","allow a recommended posology. \n","Elderly  \n","See dosage recommendations for adults. \n","Diagnostic Dose \n","The above ascending dosage schedule should be employed until sufficient diagnostic information has been obtained. \n","4.3 CONTRAINDICATIONS  \n","Adenocor is contraindicated in patients with: \n","• known hypersensitivity to adenosine \n","• sick sinus syndrome, second or third degree AV block (except in patients with a \n","functioning artificial pacemaker)  \n","• chronic obstructive lung disease (such as asthma) \n","• long QT syndrome \n","• severe hypotension; decompensated states of heart failure.  adenocor -ccdsv9 -piv6 -23aug22 Page 3 of 12 4.4 SPECIAL WARNINGS AND P RECAUTIONS FOR USE  \n","Adenosine is intended for use by physicians familiar with the product (see Section 4.2 Dose \n","and method of adm inistration ) in a hospital setting with monitoring and cardio- respiratory \n","resuscitation equipment availabl e for immediate use if necessary.  \n","The occurrence of angina, severe bradycardia, severe hypotension, respiratory failure (potentially fatal), or asystole/cardiac arrest (potentially fatal), should lead to immediate discontinuation of administration. \n","In pati ents with history of convulsions/seizures, the administration of adenosine should be \n","carefully monitored. As dipyridamole is a known inhibitor of adenosine uptake, it may potentiate the action of \n","adenosine administration. The use of Adenoscan infusion is c ontraindicated in patients \n","receiving dipyridamole (see Adenoscan Product Information: Section 4.3 C ontraindications ).  \n","If use of adenosine bolus injection (Adenocor) is judged to be essential, dipyridamole should be discontinued 24 hours beforehand or the dose of adenosine should be significantly reduced.  \n","Adenocor (adenosine) should be given as a rapid intravenous bolus.  Adenosine is ineffective in the management of SVT when given as an infusion, rather than a bolus.  This is most probably due to the diffe rent effect on sinus rate and atrioventricular nodal conduction. \n","Hypotension  \n","Because it has the potential to cause significant hypotension, adenosine should be used with caution in patients with left main coronary stenosis, uncorrected hypovolaemia, stenot ic \n","valvular heart disease, left to right shunt, pericarditis or pericardial effusion, autonomic dysfunction or stenotic carotid artery disease with cerebrovascular insufficiency.  \n","Atrial Fibrillation  \n","Adenocor  should be used with caution in patients with atrial fibrillation or flutter and especially \n","in those with an accessory by- pass tract since particularly the latter may develop increased \n","conduction down the anomalous pathway.  \n","Bradycardia  \n","Some cases of sever e bradycardia have been reported.  Some occurred in early post heart \n","transplant patients; in other cases occult sino- atrial disease was present.  The occurrence of \n","severe bradycardia should be taken as a warning of underlying disease and could potentially favour the occurrence of torsades de pointes.  \n","Heart Block and Myocardial Infarction  \n","Adenocor (adenosine) exerts its effect by decreasing conduction through the AV node and may produce a short lasting first, second or third- degree heart block.  In extreme cases, transient \n","asystole may result (one case has been reported in a patient with atrial flutter who was receiving carbamazepine).  Appropriate therapy should be instituted as needed.  Patients who develop adenocor -ccdsv9 -piv6 -23aug22 Page 4 of 12 high level block on one dose of Adenocor should not be given additional doses. Because of the \n","very short half -life of adenosine, these effects are generally self -limiting.  \n","Adenocor should be used with caution in patients with recent myocardial infarction, heart failure, or in patients with minor conducti on defects (first degree AV block, bundle branch \n","block) that could be transiently aggravated during infusion. \n","Arrhythmias at Time of Conversion  \n","At the time of conversion to normal sinus rhythm, a variety of new rhythms may appear on the electrocardiogram.  They generally last only a few seconds without intervention and may take \n","the form of premature ventricular contractions, premature atrial contractions, atrial fibrillation, sinus bradycardia, sinus tachycardia, skipped beats, sinus pause and varying degre es of AV \n","nodal block.  Such findings were seen in 55% of patients.  The induced bradycardia predisposes the patient to ventricular excitability disorders including ventricular fibrillation and torsades de pointes. \n","Because of the possible risk of torsades de pointes, Adenocor should be used with caution in \n","patients with a prolonged QT interval.  \n","Post Heart Transplantation  \n","In patients with recent heart transplantation (less than 1 year) an increased sensitivity of the heart to adenosine has been observed.  Ade nocor should be used with caution in such cases.  \n","Bronchoconstriction  \n","Adenosine administered by inhalation has been reported to cause bronchoconstriction in asthmatic patients, presumably due to mast cell degranulation and histamine release.  These effects have not been observed in normal subjects.   Adenosine has been administered to a \n","limited number of patients with asthma and mild to moderate exacerbation of their symptoms has been reported.  Adenocor should not be used in patients with asthma (see Sectio n 4.3 \n","Contraindications ). \n","Respiratory compromise has occurred during adenosine infusion in patients with obstructive pulmonary disease.  Adenocor should be used with caution in patients with obstructive lung disease not associated with bronchoconstriction (eg. emphysema, bronchitis, etc) and should be avoided in patients with bronchoconstriction or bronchospasm (eg. asthma).  Adenocor should be discontinued in any patient who develops severe respiratory difficulties. \n","Adenosine may precipitate or aggravate bronchospasm. \n","Use in hepatic impairment  \n","For further information See Section 5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties.  \n","Use in renal impairment  \n","For further information See Section 5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties.  adenocor -ccdsv9 -piv6 -23aug22 Page 5 of 12 Use in the elderly  \n","No data available.  \n","Paediatric use  \n","No data has been submitted from controlled studies in children. \n","Effects on laboratory tests  \n","No data available.  \n","4.5 INTERACTIONS  WITH OTHER MEDICINES AND OTHER FORMS OF \n","INTERACTIONS  \n","Intravenous Adenocor (adenosine) has been effectively administer ed in the presence of other \n","cardioactive drugs, such as digitalis, quinidine, beta -adrenergic blocking agents, calcium -\n","channel blocking agents, and angiotensin- converting enzyme inhibitors, without any change in \n","the adverse reaction profile.  \n","Adenosine may interact with drugs that tend to impair cardiac conduction. Aminophylline, \n","theophylline and other xanthines are competitive adenosine antagonists and should be avoided for 24 hours prior to the administration of adenosine.   Food and drinks containing xant hines \n","(e.g. tea, coffee, chocolate and cola) should be avoided for at least 12 hours prior to the administration of adenosine. \n","Nucleoside transport inhibitors such as dipyridamole inhibit adenosine cellular uptake and \n","metabolism, and potentiate the action of adenosine.  In one study dipyridamole was shown to produce a four -fold increase in adenosine activity.  The use of Adenoscan infusion is \n","contraindicated in patients receiving dipyridamole (see Adenoscan Product Information: See Section 4.3 C ontraindicat ions).  If the use of adenosine bolus injection (Adenocor) is judged to \n","be essential, dipyridamole should be discontinued 24 hours beforehand, or the dose of Adenocor should be significantly reduced.  \n","Carbamazepine has been reported to increase the degree o f heart block produced by other \n","agents.  As the primary effect of adenosine is to decrease conduction through the AV node, higher degrees of heart block may be produced in the presence of carbamazepine.  \n","4.6 FERTILITY, PREGNANCY AND LACTATION  \n","Effects on fertil ity \n","In rats and mice, adenosine administered intraperitoneally once a day for 5 days at 50, 100 and 150 mg/kg caused decreased spermatogenesis and increased numbers of abnormal sperm.  \n","Use in pregnancy  \n","Category B2 adenocor -ccdsv9 -piv6 -23aug22 Page 6 of 12 Animal reproductive studies have not been conducted with adenosine, nor have studies been \n","performed on pregnant women.  In the absence of evidence that adenosine does not cause foetal harm, Adenocor should not be used during pregnancy unless the physician considers the benefits outweigh the potential risks. \n","Use in lactation  \n","Studies have not been performed in lactating animals or women.  Therefore, adenosine should not be used during lactation.  If adenosine treatment is considered essential by the physician, another form of infant feeding should be considered. \n","4.7 EFFECTS ON ABILITY TO DRIVE AND USE MACHINES  \n","The effects of this medicine on a person's ability to drive and use machines were not assessed as part of its registration.  \n","4.8 ADVERSE EFFECTS (UNDESIRABLE EFFECTS)  \n","The following adverse reactions have been reported with adenosine rapid intravenous bolus injection.

This action can interrupt re -entry circuits involving the AV node and restore normal \n","sinus rhythm in patients with paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardias and paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardias associated with Wolff -Parkinson- White Syndrome.  Once the \n","circuit has been interrupted, the tachycardia stops and normal sinus rhythm is re -established.  adenocor -ccdsv9 -piv6 -23aug22 Page 9 of 12 By transiently slowing AV conduction, atrial activity is to evaluate from ECG recordings and \n","therefore Adenocor can aid the diagnosis of broad or narrow QRS complex tachycardias. \n","Adenocor may be useful during electrophysiological studies to determine the site of AV block \n","or to determine , in some cases of pre- excitation, whether conduction is occurring by an \n","accessory pathway or via the AV node. \n","Haemodynamics  \n","The usual intravenous bolus dose of 3 or 6 mg Adenocor usually has no systemic \n","haemodynamic effects.  Rarely significant hypotension and tachycardia have been observed. When larger doses are given by infusion, adenosine decreases blood pressure by decreasing peripheral resistance.  \n","Clinical trials  \n","No data available.  \n","5.2 PHARMACOKINETIC PROPERTIES  \n","Intravenously administered Adenocor (adenosine) is removed from the circulation very rapidly.  Following an intravenous bolus, adenosine is taken up by erythrocytes and vascular \n","endothelial cells.  The half -life of intravenous adenosine is estimated to be less than 10 seconds.  \n","Adenosine enters the body pool and is primarily metabolised to inosine and adenosine \n","monophosphate (AMP). \n","Hepatic and Renal Failure \n","Hepatic and renal failure should have no effect on the activity of a bolus Adenocor (adenosine) injection.  Since Adenocor (adenosine)  has a direct action, hepatic and renal function are not \n","required for the activity or metabolism of a bolus adenosine injection. \n","5.3 PRECLINICAL SAFETY DATA \n","Genotoxicity  \n","Adenosine tested negative for mutation in the Salmonella/Mammalian Microsome Assay.  Adenosine, like other nucleosides at millimolar concentrations present for several doubling times of cells in culture, is known to produce a variety of chromosomal alterations. \n","Carcinogenicity  \n","Studies in animals have not been performed to evaluate the carcinogenic potential of Adenocor.  adenocor -ccdsv9 -piv6 -23aug22 Page 10 of 12 6 PHARMACEUTICAL PARTICULARS  \n","6.1 LIST OF EXCIPIENTS  \n","Sodium chloride  \n","Water for injections  \n","6.2 INCOMPATIBILITIES  \n","Incompatibilities were either not assessed or not identified  as part of the registration of this \n","medicine.  \n","6.3 SHELF LIFE  \n","In Australia, information on the shelf life can be found on the public summary of the Australian \n","Register of Therapeutic Goods (ARTG).

aug page of australian product i nformation – adenocor® name of the medicine adenosine qualitative and quantitative composition each vial contains mg of adenosine in ml of a . wv solution of sodium chloride in sterile water for injections. for the full list of excipients, see section . list of excipients. pharmaceutical form adenocor is a clear colourless sterile solution for intravenous injection rapid bolus. clinical particulars . therapeutic indications rapid conversion to a normal sinus rhythm of paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardias, including those associated with accessory bypass tracts wolff parkinson white syndrome . diagnostic indications aid to diagnosis of broad or narrow qrs complex supraventricular tachycardias. although adenocor is not effective in converting atrial flutter, atrial fibrillation or ventricular tachycardia to sinus rhythm, the slowing of av conduction helps diagnosis of atrial activity. in this respect adenosine should be used as an adjunct to, but not a replacement for, clinical and ecg observations. it should be used only when, despite all diagnostic attempts, doubt still persists. improved diagnostic sensitivity of intracavity electrophysiological investigations. . dose and method administration adenocor should be used only in hospitals, with monitoring and cardiorespiratory resuscitation equipment available for immediate use if necessary. it should be administered by rapid iv bolus injection according to the ascending dosage schedule below. to be certain the sol ution reaches the systemic circulation, it should be administered either directly into a vein or into an adenocor ccdsv piv aug page of iv line. if administered via an iv line it should be injected as proximally as possible, and followed by a rapid saline flush. adenocor should only be used when facilities exist for cardiac monitoring. patients who develop high level av block at a particular dose should not be given further dosage increments. therapeutic dose adults initial dose mg given as a rapid intravenous bolus over seconds. second dose if the first dose does not result in the elimination of supraventricular tachycardia within or minutes, mg should be given also as a rapid intravenous bolus. third dose if the second dose does not result in the elimination of supraventricular tachycardia within or minutes, mg should be given also as a rapid intravenous bolus. children no controlled paediatric studies have been undertaken, therefore the level of evidence does not allow a recommended posology. elderly see dosage recommendations for adults. diagnostic dose the above ascending dosage schedule should be employed until sufficient diagnostic information has been obtained. . contraindications adenocor is contraindicated in patients with • known hypersensitivity to adenosine • sick sinus syndrome, second or third degree av block except in patients with a functioning artificial pacemaker • chronic obstructive lung disease • long qt syndrome • severe hypotension decompensated states of heart failure. adenocor ccdsv piv aug page of . special warnings and p recautions for use adenosine is intended for use by physicians familiar with the product see section . dose and method of adm inistration in a hospital setting with monitoring and cardio respiratory resuscitation equipment availabl e for immediate use if necessary. the occurrence of angina, severe bradycardia, severe hypotension, respiratory failure potentially fatal, or asystolecardiac arrest potentially fatal, should lead to immediate discontinuation of administration. in pati ents with history of convulsionsseizures, the administration of adenosine should be carefully monitored. as dipyridamole is a known inhibitor of adenosine uptake, it may potentiate the action of adenosine administration. the use of adenoscan infusion is c ontraindicated in patients receiving dipyridamole see adenoscan product information section . c ontraindications . if use of adenosine bolus injectionis judged to be essential, dipyridamole should be discontinued hours beforehand or the dose of adenosine should be significantly reduced. adenocorshould be given as a rapid intravenous bolus. adenosine is ineffective in the management of svt when given as an infusion, rather than a bolus. this is most probably due to the diffe rent effect on sinus rate and atrioventricular nodal conduction. hypotension because it has the potential to cause significant hypotension, adenosine should be used with caution in patients with left main coronary stenosis, uncorrected hypovolaemia, stenot ic valvular heart disease, left to right shunt, pericarditis or pericardial effusion, autonomic dysfunction or stenotic carotid artery disease with cerebrovascular insufficiency. atrial fibrillation adenocor should be used with caution in patients with atrial fibrillation or flutter and especially in those with an accessory by pass tract since particularly the latter may develop increased conduction down the anomalous pathway. bradycardia some cases of sever e bradycardia have been reported. some occurred in early post heart transplant patients in other cases occult sino atrial disease was present. the occurrence of severe bradycardia should be taken as a warning of underlying disease and could potentially favour the occurrence of torsades de pointes. heart block and myocardial infarction adenocorexerts its effect by decreasing conduction through the av node and may produce a short lasting first, second or third degree heart block. in extreme cases, transient asystole may result one case has been reported in a patient with atrial flutter who was receiving carbamazepine. appropriate therapy should be instituted as needed. patients who develop adenocor ccdsv piv aug page of high level block on one dose of adenocor should not be given additional doses. because of the very short half life of adenosine, these effects are generally self limiting. adenocor should be used with caution in patients with recent myocardial infarction, heart failure, or in patients with minor conducti on defects first degree av block, bundle branch block that could be transiently aggravated during infusion. arrhythmias at time of conversion at the time of conversion to normal sinus rhythm, a variety of new rhythms may appear on the electrocardiogram. they generally last only a few seconds without intervention and may take the form of premature ventricular contractions, premature atrial contractions, atrial fibrillation, sinus bradycardia, sinus tachycardia, skipped beats, sinus pause and varying degre es of av nodal block. such findings were seen in of patients. the induced bradycardia predisposes the patient to ventricular excitability disorders including ventricular fibrillation and torsades de pointes. because of the possible risk of torsades de pointes, adenocor should be used with caution in patients with a prolonged qt interval. post heart transplantation in patients with recent heart transplantationan increased sensitivity of the heart to adenosine has been observed. ade nocor should be used with caution in such cases. bronchoconstriction adenosine administered by inhalation has been reported to cause bronchoconstriction in asthmatic patients, presumably due to mast cell degranulation and histamine release. these effects have not been observed in normal subjects. adenosine has been administered to a limited number of patients with asthma and mild to moderate exacerbation of their symptoms has been reported. adenocor should not be used in patients with asthma see sectio n . contraindications . respiratory compromise has occurred during adenosine infusion in patients with obstructive pulmonary disease. adenocor should be used with caution in patients with obstructive lung disease not associated with bronchoconstrictionand should be avoided in patients with bronchoconstriction or bronchospasm eg. asthma. adenocor should be discontinued in any patient who develops severe respiratory difficulties. adenosine may precipitate or aggravate bronchospasm. use in hepatic impairment for further information see section . pharmacokinetic properties. use in renal impairment for further information see section . pharmacokinetic properties. adenocor ccdsv piv aug page of use in the elderly no data available. paediatric use no data has been submitted from controlled studies in children. effects on laboratory tests no data available. . interactions with other medicines and other forms of interactions intravenous adenocorhas been effectively administer ed in the presence of other cardioactive drugs, such as digitalis, quinidine, beta adrenergic blocking agents, calcium channel blocking agents, and angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors, without any change in the adverse reaction profile. adenosine may interact with drugs that tend to impair cardiac conduction. aminophylline, theophylline and other xanthines are competitive adenosine antagonists and should be avoided for hours prior to the administration of adenosine. food and drinks containing xant hinesshould be avoided for at least hours prior to the administration of adenosine. nucleoside transport inhibitors such as dipyridamole inhibit adenosine cellular uptake and metabolism, and potentiate the action of adenosine. in one study dipyridamole was shown to produce a four fold increase in adenosine activity. the use of adenoscan infusion is contraindicated in patients receiving dipyridamoleis judged to be essential, dipyridamole should be discontinued hours beforehand, or the dose of adenocor should be significantly reduced. carbamazepine has been reported to increase the degree o f heart block produced by other agents. as the primary effect of adenosine is to decrease conduction through the av node, higher degrees of heart block may be produced in the presence of carbamazepine. . fertility, pregnancy and lactation effects on fertil ity in rats and mice, adenosine administered intraperitoneally once a day for days at , and mgkg caused decreased spermatogenesis and increased numbers of abnormal sperm. use in pregnancy category b adenocor ccdsv piv aug page of animal reproductive studies have not been conducted with adenosine, nor have studies been performed on pregnant women. in the absence of evidence that adenosine does not cause foetal harm, adenocor should not be used during pregnancy unless the physician considers the benefits outweigh the potential risks. use in lactation studies have not been performed in lactating animals or women. therefore, adenosine should not be used during lactation. if adenosine treatment is considered essential by the physician, another form of infant feeding should be considered. . effects on ability to drive and use machines the effects of this medicine on a person's ability to drive and use machines were not assessed as part of its registration. . adverse effects the following adverse reactions have been reported with adenosine rapid intravenous bolus injection. these adverse reactions have been classified using standard terminology and are categorised by body system. they are listed in order of dec reasing frequency according to the following definitions very common ≥ common ≥ and uncommon ≥ and rare ≥ and very rare not known cann ot be estimated from available data. cardiovascular system very common bradycardia sinus pause, skipped beats atrial extrasystoles a v block ventricular excitability disorders such as ventricular extrasystoles, non sustained ventricular tachycardia. uncommon sinus tachycardia palpitations. very rare atrial fibrillation ventricular

sometimes severe, ha s been reported. there have been reports of cerebrovascular accidenttransient ischemic attack, secondary to the hemodynamic effects of adenosine, including hypotension. cases of asystolecardiac arrest, sometimes fatal especially in patients with underlyi ng ischaemic heart diseasecardiac disorder have been reported see section . special warnings and p recautions for use . adenocor ccdsv piv aug page of loss of consciousnesssyncope, and convulsions especially in predisposed patients have been reported see section . special warnings and precautions for use . apnoearespiratory arrest, and respiratory failurehave been reported. cases of fatal outcome of respiratory failure, of bronchospasm, and of apnoearespiratory arrest have also been reported. cases of vomiting have been reported. other reports include tingling in arms, numbness, pressure in groin and transient increase in blood pressure. myocardial infarction and st segment elevation have been reported, especially in pat ients with preexisting severe coronary artery disease. anaphylactic reactions, including angioedema and skin reactions such as urticaria and rash, have been reported. reporting suspected adverse effects reporting suspected adverse reactions after registration of the medicinal product is important. it allows continued monitoring of the benefit risk balance of the medicinal product. healthcare professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reaction s at www.tga.gov.aureporting problems australia. . overdose as the half life of adenosine is very short less than seconds, adverse effects are generally rapidly self limiting. treatment of any prolonged adverse effects should be individualised and be directed toward the specific symptoms. methylxanthines, such as caffeine and theophylline, and aminophylline are competitive antagonists of adenosine. intravenous aminophylline or theophylline may be needed. for information on the management of overdose, contact the poisons information centre on . pharmacological properties . pharmacodynamic properties pharmacotherapeutic group other cardiac preparations, atc code ceb mechanism of action adenocor administered by rapid intravenous injections depresses conduction through the av node. this action can interrupt re entry circuits involving the av node and restore normal sinus rhythm in patients with paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardias and paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardias associated with wolff parkinson white syndrome. once the circuit has been interrupted, the tachycardia stops and normal sinus rhythm is re established. adenocor ccdsv piv aug page of by transiently slowing av conduction, atrial activity is to evaluate from ecg recordings and therefore adenocor can aid the diagnosis of broad or narrow qrs complex tachycardias. adenocor may be useful during electrophysiological studies to determine the site of av block or to determine , in some cases of pre excitation, whether conduction is occurring by an accessory pathway or via the av node. haemodynamics the usual intravenous bolus dose of or mg adenocor usually has no systemic haemodynamic effects. rarely significant hypotension and tachycardia have been observed. when larger doses are given by infusion, adenosine decreases blood pressure by decreasing peripheral resistance. clinical trials no data available. . pharmacokinetic properties intravenously administered adenocoris removed from the circulation very rapidly. following an intravenous bolus, adenosine is taken up by erythrocytes and vascular endothelial cells. the half life of intravenous adenosine is estimated to be less than seconds. adenosine enters the body pool and is primarily metabolised to inosine and adenosine monophosphate amp. hepatic and renal failure hepatic and renal failure should have no effect on the activity of a bolus adenocorinjection. since adenocor has a direct action, hepatic and renal function are not required for the activity or metabolism of a bolus adenosine injection. . preclinical safety data genotoxicity adenosine tested negative for mutation in the salmonellamammalian microsome assay. adenosine, like other nucleosides at millimolar concentrations present for several doubling times of cells in culture, is known to produce a variety of chromosomal alterations.
